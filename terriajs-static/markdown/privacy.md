# Privacy

## Privacy

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is covered by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘the Privacy Act’). The Privacy Act contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (‘the APPs’) which governs how Australian Government agencies should collect, use, store and disclose personal information, and how individuals can access records containing their personal information. General information about the Privacy Act and the APPs can be found on the website of the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-news).

We are committed to protecting your privacy. [Our Privacy Policy can be accessed via this link](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/accountability-and-reporting/pmc-privacy-practices/privacy-policy). The NationalMap website (this website) complies with the Australian Information Commissioner’s APP Guidelines and with our APP Privacy Policy.

You are reminded that there are risks involved in sending information over the internet.

Any data collected by us as described in this notice is stored securely, and archived for a period of at least five years, and possible up to ten years.
